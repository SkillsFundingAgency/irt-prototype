                    Our ethos on this hands-on course is practice, practice, practice. You will write, plan and make films in the studio and on location; producing work amongst a community of filmmakers, and becoming immersed in the hands-on experience of making films. You will work in production teams to produce a range of films, providing the professional experience and abilities to prepare you for work in the film and screen industries. There is a strong focus on production; supported by watching, investigating, analysing, critiquing and thinking about film in order to discover your own identity as a filmmaker. Working in small groups with other passionate filmmakers, you will take an active role in all stages of development and production, learning the skills of directing, producing, cinematography, sound, editing, production design and storytelling. Our students enjoy creative freedom and have the opportunity to pitch and initiate experimental projects across a wide range of productions, from fiction to documentary, advertising to music. You will develop professional and business skills such as self promotion, finance and distribution, and learn to commercialise practical experiences and skills to successfully navigate the film industry. Learning and teaching is supported through filmmaking practice: in the studio, on location, in screenwriting seminars and film screenings, production meetings and class discussions, industry talks and study trips including film festivals. Our students will bring with them an enthusiasm for film and screen, and a commitment to filmmaking. This is a challenging course where hard work will give you the knowledge and experience needed by a filmmaker.
